# Chirper Client



This repository contains the implementation of the client side of the project.


# Methodology used
Instead of creating a single repo for each challenge and as i'm familiar with github it condensed the api challenges in one package/repo.
As it's not in direct contradiction of the rules and/or objective.
In terms of development methodology i used the following:
  - /src/
    - this folder contains the implementation part of the client
  - /src/App/components/
    - this folder contains all the view implementation and also the logic used. 
  - /src/App/Assets/
    - Inside this folder are the shiny shiny bits of the project
  - /src/App/services
    - this folder contains the service logic used



### Tech

this set of challenges uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Electron] - Is an open-source framework developed by GitHub.It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using the Node.js runtime
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Angular] - Great Javascript based framework for implementing either MVC or MVVM architectures.



And of course the implementation of the challenges themselves are open source with a [git-repo-url]
 on GitHub.
