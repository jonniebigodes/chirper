# Chirper



This repository contains the implementation of a pet project.


# Methodology used
Instead of creating a single repo for each client and server a single repository was created for it, for containing the server and client.

In terms of development methodology it's used the following:
  - /chirper-client/
    - This folder contains the implementation bits for the client side of the project.
  - /chirper-server/
    - this folder contains all the implementation bits for the server side of the project. 
  



### Tech

this set of challenges uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Electron] - Is an open-source framework developed by GitHub.It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using the Node.js runtime
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework 
* [Webpack] - fast packaging framework for deployment
* [Mongodb] - Best of relational with the innovations of NOSQL
* [Angular] - Great Javascript based framework for implementing either MVC or MVVM architectures.




And of course the implementation of the challenges themselves are open source with a [git-repo-url]
 on GitHub.

### Installation from source
